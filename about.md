Hi, I'm John Clements!

I'm a data scientist working in the energy sector. Prior to being a data scientist, I did a brief stint as a quantitative developer. In addition to statstics and machine learning, I enjoy fantasy and sci-fi novels, strength training, and traveling (I know, everyone does).

I did my undergrad at UNC Chapel Hill in Economics and Political Science. I have a Master's in Statistics from NC State and International Relations and Economics from Johns Hopkins.
